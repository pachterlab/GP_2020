# algorithm
The directory `algorithm` contains codes to run the special function method and compare it to stochastic simulation and numerical integration methods. The following files are provided: 

`example_use.m`: MATLAB code to run a stochastic simulation with a set of parameters, then compare the distributions to those generated by directly solving the Chemical Master Equation.

`example_use.pdf`: Published MATLAB output of the visualization code.

All others: As described in `fig_2a`  and `fig_2b` directories.
