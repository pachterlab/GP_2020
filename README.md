This repository contains MATLAB codes for the paper "Special Function Methods for Bursty Models of Transcription." The `algorithm` directory contains an implementation of the algorithm for the degenerate bursty transcription/splicing/degradation system. The others contain codes to reproduce Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 1.
