This repository contains code to reproduce the results of the paper "Special Function Methods for Bursty Models of Transcription" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12919). The `algorithm` directory contains an implementation of the algorithm for the degenerate bursty transcription/splicing/degradation system. The other directories contain the code to reproduce Figure 2 and the Supplementary Figures.
